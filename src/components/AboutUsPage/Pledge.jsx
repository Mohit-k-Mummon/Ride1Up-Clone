					Replacing cars on the road has always been a big initiative for Ride1Up. We

					smallest changes have the potential to lead to big impacts on the environment
					and oneâ€™s health. Commit to replace at least 2 car trips per month with your
					electric bike by entering your email below to subscribe, and we will reward you
					with $40 off your purchase of a Ride1Up electric bike.
