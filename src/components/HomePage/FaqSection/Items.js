				<p>
					EBikes come with a range of <span>battery sizes</span>, accessories, and{' '}
					<span>warranty periods</span>, and the life span of the battery will vary with
					how often you ride, your charging habits, and the maintenance you invest in your
					new bike.
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically, ebike batteries will last up to about five years if you store your
					bike in dry conditions, keep the charging ports clean, and avoid discharging the
					bike completely. Consistently allowing your bike battery to fully discharge will
					increase the risk of cell degradation and needing to replace the battery for
					your eBike much sooner!'

					The distance an electric bike covers depend on several factors. The main element
					is the size of the bike battery. After battery capacity, external factors impact
					the range of an electric bike. Some of these factors include rider weight,

					gearing, inclines, and the level of motor assistance/throttle used during your
					bike ride,

					The range of our top-quality electric bicycles will vary from model to model.
					Electric bicycles with larger batteries such as the Cafe Cruiser can provide up

				<p>
					An electric bike doesn’t usually need a license to ride, and no specific federal
					laws cover licensing requirements for eBikes. However, state regulations vary,
					so the best advice is to check out your local DMV site and double-check the
					licensing requirements in your region before you shop for an electric bike.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most eBikes do not require insurance, tax, licensing, or registration, but more
					powerful eBikes might have varying requirements. It’s also worth considering
					where you plan to ride eBikes because local regulations for a bike driven on the
					streets can differ.

					The majority of Ride1Up’s Class 3 electric bikes are rated to go 28 mph on pedal
					assist.

					Yes! The motor on an ebike may make bicycling easier but at the end of the day,
					you are still staying active and moving your body during your bike ride. Studies
					show that riding eBikes can support a healthier lifestyle, improving cardio
					conditioning and brain function. While you have a handy motor to help you out of
					sticky spots (or steep hills), pedaling an electric bicycle burns around 444
					calories an hour–that’s only 20% lower than a conventional bike!

					All our electric bikes are engineered with exceptional quality components, offer

					While we do not recommend leaving the e-bikes out in the rain or riding in
					hazardous conditions due to personal safety, our eBikes can be ridden in the

					bike dry and protected from the elements will increase the lifespan of the bike.

					Choosing a high-quality bike can make your daily travel quicker, cheaper, and
					healthier–but picking the right electric bike is very much a personal choice,
					depending on a whole host of factors.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, you’ll need to consider your budget, the frame style, size, and
					color you want, and whether you’re after an urban bike, a casual electric bike
					for occasional trips, or a more powerful bike to tackle tough hills.
				</p>

					<span>
						Our Core-5 model is an exceptional value e-bike for first-time riders
					</span>
					, and the 700 Series is a top-of-the-range model loaded with features for
					advanced performance. However, we’d recommend considering what you want to
					prioritize rather than suggesting that one specific model is the best option for
					every electric bike rider.

		title: 'Which Cheap Electric Bike is Best?',

				<p>
					All Ride1Up e-bikes offer seriously competitive value, and we’d be reluctant to
					suggest that the cheapest electric bikes have the level of functionality,
					comfort, and aesthetic appeal we believe are important to your bike riding
					experience. Very cheap e-bikes have reduced power, performance, and longevity
					and don’t make the cut when it comes to balancing value against quality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our advice is to invest in an electric bike designed to withstand the rigors of
					the road, with each model developed with precision detail to provide the highest
					possible performance without costing a fortune. When you shop for bikes, you
					will want to consider price, accessories, warranty policies, customer support,
					and service options. Test riding various bikes can also be a valuable step to
					compare different bike options and find the one that best fits your needs.

					Ride1Up specializes in Class 3 electric bikes–these bikes can reach speeds of up

					assisted speeds in our product specs and accessories, including advice about
					adjusting the settings in your bike display in our support platform.

					It remains essential to observe local speed limits because not every state has
					adopted the same classification system. There may be different speed limits for
					cycle lanes and travel routes that permit electric bikes.

		title: 'What Are the Three Types of E-Bikes?',
		content: (

				<p>
					Electric bikes are classified as Class 1, 2, or 3 based on the operation of the
					motor. As a quick summary of the bike classifications:
				</p>
				<p>
					Class 1 e-bikes have an upper-speed limit of twenty MPH, with a pedal
					assist-only electric motor. <br /> Class 2 models incorporate throttles, where
					the motor stops assisting the rider when the bike reaches twenty MPH. <br />{' '}
					Class 3 electric bikes have a motor, pedal assist, and a maximum speed of
					approximately twenty-eight MPH.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, Ride1Up has incorporated a 20 PMH throttle into most of their class 3
					bikes too.

				<p>
					Like all things e-bikes, the range is impacted by variables such as whether
					you’re riding uphill or downhill, the bike motor and battery size, tire spec and
					condition, and even the strength of the wind!
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s also worth noting that a bike is designed for pedaling rather than
					operating like a moped or electric motorbike, which runs solely on the motor.
					You wouldn’t expect to sit stationary on the bike without pedaling at all, but
					you can cruise downhill without much pedal power.
				</p>
				<p>
					You’ll find ranges for each model on our electric bike product page, from twenty
					to thirty miles on the Roadster V2 to thirty to fifty miles on the LMT’D,
					Prodigy, 700 Series, and Cafe Cruiser.
